# Creational Pattern

### Prototype Design Pattern
- The Prototype Design Pattern is a `creational pattern` that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, called a prototype. 
- Instead of creating a new object from scratch, you duplicate an existing instance. This pattern is particularly useful when creating a new object is costly or complex, and the new object mostly resembles an existing one.

### Singleton Design Pattern
- Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java Virtual Machine. 
- The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class. Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching, and thread pool.

### Factory Design Pattern
- In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

### Builder Design Pattern
- A Builder class builds the final object step by step. This builder is independent of other objects.



# Behavioral Pattern

### Observer Design Pattern
- Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.
- It is like pubsub concept.

### Strategy Design Pattern
* A strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows the behavior of an object to be selected at runtime.
* It is one of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, which are widely used in object-oriented programming.
