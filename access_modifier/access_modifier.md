## Access Modifier in Java

### Public Access Modifier
- The public access modifier has the widest scope among all other access modifiers.
- Classes, methods, or data members that are declared as public are accessible from everywhere in the program. There is no restriction on the scope of public data members.


### Private Access Modifier
The methods or data members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared.

### Protected Access Modifier
- A protected member is accessible within its own package.
- A protected member is accessible by subclasses of its class in different packages.

### Default Access Modifier
- Accessible only within the same package.
- Not accessible outside the package, even in subclasses.
